# Profiling Your Data With Pandas Profiling

1. Load your data from a database or csv into a pandas dataframe
2. Create the profile report using pandas_profiling
3. Optionally save your report as an `.html` file

## Requirements

1. Python 3.x. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is the easiest install. To keep life simple, **be sure to choose "Just Me"** when prompted by the installer.
2. A few python packages: `pip install jupyter pandas sqlalchemy pandas_profiling pyodbc healthcareai`
3. From your Anaconda Prompt run: `jupyter notebook`. This will open a web browser.
